# Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) with various functionalities and puzzles. The BST implementation is assessed based on the following criteria:

## Part 1: BST Functionalities

- **Function `bst_create()`:** Correctly allocates and initializes a BST.
- **Function `bst_free()`:** Correctly frees the memory allocated to a BST with no memory leaks.
- **Function `bst_size()`:** Correctly determines the number of elements in a BST.
- **Function `bst_insert()`:** Correctly inserts a key/value pair into a BST, maintaining the BST property with respect to all keys in the tree.
- **Function `bst_remove()`:** Correctly removes a key/value pair from a BST based on a specified key, maintaining the BST property with respect to all keys in the tree.
- **Function `bst_get()`:** Correctly retrieves the value associated with a given key in a BST.

## Part 2: BST "Puzzles"

This section contains various puzzles related to BST operations, and the implementation is assessed based on the following criteria:

- **Function `bst_height()`:** Correctly computes the height of a BST.
- **Function `bst_path_sum()`:** Correctly validates a path sum in a BST.
- **Function `bst_range_sum()`:** Correctly computes a range sum in a BST.
